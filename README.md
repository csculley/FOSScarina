# The first app for 12 and 4 hole ocarinas that just happens to be 100% free and open-source!

### Inspiration
While there are a lot of apps that do 4-hole ocarinas, 12-hole ocarinas have been left out in the dust. Luckily, we're here to change that!

### What it does
Our app emulates both 12 and 4 hole ocarinas, with plans to expand into 6 and 10 hole ocarinas in the future! Simply put your fingers on the screen, or in the case with the 12 and 10- hole ocarinas, put both thumbs on the volume buttons while pressing the rest of your fingers on the screen!

### How we built it
We used Android Studio 3.0.0 to build a native Android app from scratch.

### Challenges we ran into
Having never used Android Studio before, learning the ins and outs of Android on the spot was a bit difficult. In addition, we had to come up with manual implementations for several integral functions, such as sound production, that Android's base SDK didn't support.

### Accomplishments that we're proud of
While it was bumpy along the way, we managed to ship a working demo of FOSScarina with support for 4 and 12-hole ocarinas. This involved many different elements, such as sound production and the use of multiple fragments.

### What we learned
Our crash-course in Android development!

### What's next for FOSScarina
Stay tuned to FOSScarina's plans to expand into 6 and 10 hole ocarinas in the future!
